The National Honor Society (NHS) is the nation's premier organization established to recognize outstanding high school students. More than just an honor roll, NHS serves to honor those students who have demonstrated excellence in the areas of Scholarship, Leadership, Service, and Character. These characteristics have been associated with membership in the organization since its beginnings in 1921.
 
The Northwest Pennsylvania Collegiate Academy chapter of the National Honor Society was established in 1998, and its members have been serving our school and greater community ever since.  Each year in September, rising juniors who have a grade point average of at least 3.5 are invited to apply for membership.  The application process includes demonstrating 25 hours of community service, obtaining two teacher recommendations and one coach recommendation (if applicable), and writing an essay on an experience related to scholarship, leadership, service, or character. A selection committee review applications and makes decisions about acceptance.  The induction ceremony for juniors selected to be members takes place in early November.
